<h4>June 2018</h4>
<div class="box">
	<div class="newstext">Rylee Trendell and Marissa Eckman gave a fantastic presentation of their research at the International Urban Wildlife Conference. They presented their work from the spring semester looking at how landscape affects population genetic connectivity in Pacific treefrogs.</div>

<h4>Nov 2018</h4>
<div class="box">
	<div class="newstext">Marissa presented her future research project at the Pacific Undergraduate Research Conference. She'll be collecting genomic data for the Oregon Slender Salamander to determine the genetic diversity and recent history of suburban populations.</div>

<h4>Oct 2018</h4>
<div class="box">
	<div class="newstext">We received funding from Oregon Wildlife Foundation to support our research with the Oregon slender salamander. This species has a narrow range in the Cascades, but suburban populations in Gresham and Portland were discovered relatively recently. Funding from OWF will help us to determine the genetic distinctiveness, source, and connectivity of these populations so that sound conservation management decisions can be made to support this species.</div>
