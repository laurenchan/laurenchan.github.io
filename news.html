<div class="box">
	<div class="newstext">Rylee Trendell and Marissa Eckman gave a fantastic poster of their research at the International Urban Wildlife Conference. They presented their work from the spring semester looking at how landscape affects population genetic connectivity in Pacific treefrogs. Lauren also presented, giving a talk in the Urban Habitat Connectivity session on genetic connectivity in the Northern red-legged frog. </div>

	<div class="newstext">
Eight of Lauren's capstone students presented their original research at Pacific's annual Senior Projects Day! They all did a great job! Tiffani, Candice, and Marissa used genetic data to study population connectivity in Pacific Treefrogs. Leigh and Kaleb, and Marcel  developed genetic markers to detect the presence of particular species (e.g. beaver, nutria, and northern red-legged frogs) from environmental DNA samples. Wyatt and Alison, Bioinformatics majors, presented their work developing tools to study protocadherin evolution across the vertebrate tree.</div>

<h4>Nov 2018</h4>

<h4>Oct 2018</h4>
<div class="box">
	<div class="newstext">We received funding from Oregon Wildlife Foundation to support our research with the Oregon slender salamander. This species has a narrow range in the Cascades, but suburban populations in Gresham and Portland were discovered relatively recently. Funding from OWF will help us to determine the genetic distinctiveness, source, and connectivity of these populations so that sound conservation management decisions can be made to support this species.</div>
