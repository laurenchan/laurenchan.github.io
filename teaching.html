    <h3>Vertebrate Zoology, BIOL420</h3>
    A study of the vertebrates, including their systematics, life histories, morphological and physiological adaptations, behavior and conservation. Laboratory work (including investigative and observational studies as well as taxonomy and comparative morphology) and field experiences (to local wetlands, streams and forests) are integrated in the course.

    <h3>Evolution, BIOL444</h3>
    Examines evidence for evolution and explanations for patterns of diversity and the apparent fit of organisms to the environment. Topics include the basis for evolutionary change, population level processes, natural selection, sexual selection, speciation mechanisms, and long-term macroevolutionary patterns. Includes a laboratory experience.

     <h3>Advanced Research Methods, BIOL489</h3>
     This course focuses on using genetic data to address research questions of conservation importance. Students will work collaboratively to investigate original research questions using a combination of field, laboratory, and analytical approaches. Projects include studies of amphibians and reptiles from western North America and students will gain research experience in all aspects of research from formation of a question to data collection and analysis to interpretation and presentation.
