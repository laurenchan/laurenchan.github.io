	<h1>Fall 2018</h1>
		<h2>New course: BIOL355 - Evolution and Biodiversity</h2>
		Investigation of the evolutionary processes responsible for the origin and diversification of life on Earth. This course covers major concepts in evolutionary biology, including the origin of molecular variation, mechanisms of evolutionary change, patterns of speciation and extinction, and the diversity and evolutionary relationships of living organisms. <em>Note: This course may be substituted for either BIOL312 or BIOL313.</em>
		<p>&nbsp</p>

		<h2>BIOL420 - Vertebrate Zoology</h2>
		A study of the vertebrates, including their systematics, life histories, morphological and physiological adaptations, behavior and conservation. Laboratory work (including investigative and observational studies as well as taxonomy and comparative morphology) and field experiences (to local wetlands, streams and forests) are integrated in the course.
		<p>&nbsp</p>

	<h1>Winter/Spring 2019</h1>
     <h2>Advanced Research Methods, BIOL489</h2>
     This course focuses on using genetic data to address research questions of conservation importance. Students will work collaboratively to investigate original research questions using a combination of field, laboratory, and analytical approaches. Projects include studies of amphibians and reptiles from western North America and students will gain research experience in all aspects of research from formation of a question to data collection and analysis to interpretation and presentation.
