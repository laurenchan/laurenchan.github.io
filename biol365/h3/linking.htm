Many     educators and employers are coming to realize that students with this type     of rigid training often lack the creative thinking and problem-solving skills     that they need in a working environment with constant demands to learn and     apply new skills. These educators and employers are interested in systems     that emphasize active learning as a way to address these concerns.</p></td>    <td width="50" height="228" valign="top"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="21" height="2413" valign="top"></td>    <td width="34" height="2413" valign="top"></td>    <td width="5" height="2413" valign="top"></td>    <td width="580" height="2413" colspan="5" valign="top">   <p>Many of the authors that explore the origins of creative thought emphasize     the role that practicing the arts (rather than simply experiencing them) have     in developing well-rounded, adaptive and creative individuals. Historically,     the practice of the arts was seen as beneficial to the study of science but     our current educational system does not share this view. By recombining the     study of science with the practice of the arts, students can realize the benefits     of enhanced creativity and better problem solving skills.Our drawing class     seeks to incorporate these concepts into the biology curriculum by adding     the study of drawing as an aid to improve observational skills. </p>      <p>In a common model of the current biology curriculum, a student is required         to memorize and classify a great deal of data. This helps the student         begin to understand relationships between various life forms and body         parts as well as the systems that enable them to function. In addition         to memorization, many instructors require their students to draw the organisms         that they are studying, knowing that, through drawing, a different kind         of information processing is occurring. </p>  <p>Drawing through observation helps to reinforce the defining characteristics     of specific groups of organisms, such as the number of appendages, segmentation,     or type of symmetry. Because our educational systems have become compartmentalized,     biology and anatomy students are told to draw in order to help them record     their observations but they are never given any instruction on how to do this.     Without instruction, students who are not predisposed to draw are left feeling     incompetent ("I can't draw!") and are unable to take advantage of the benefits     this tool offers. Drawing through observation is a skill which most people     are capable of learning. Unfortunately, many students are intimidated by the     drawing process, having given it up when their inability to draw things realistically     caused enough frustration for them to decide that they have no drawing aptitude.     Students with this perception of their drawing abilities are unlikely to become     enthusiastic when their professor suggests that they draw in order to increase     their comprehension. In fact, they complain saying; "This is a biology class,     not an art class!" Biology students who take our drawing class learn to use     a tool that can be useful to them for the rest of their lives, whether or     not they pursue careers in science. The ability to observe the world around     them enriches their experience of life, while learning a skill that they may     have thought was beyond their reach inspires new confidence in their abilities.   </p>  <p>The physical act of drawing mostly consists of developing hand-eye coordination.     Anyone who can write legibly has the physical ability to record observations     of a subject through drawing. Many people would disagree with this statement     by saying that they have no talent for art. Although it is true that there     are those with more artistic ability than others, this is hardly a reason     to avoid the practice. There are many people of all ages who enjoy the game     of basketball even though they will never play at the level of Michael Jordan.     Though some people cook better than others, few people eat all of their meals     in restaurants. In an academic setting, educators expect their students to     reach a certain proficiency in math or written language even though few are     capable of the genius of Einstein or Hemingway. For someone studying anatomy     or biology, it is not even necessary that their drawing look like the object     being drawn. All that is necessary is that the person has processed information     through the act of drawing and thereby achieved a new level of understanding.     This is the essence of active learning; learning through doing rather than     through merely looking at a picture or listening to a lecture. A person can     benefit from the activity at any level of proficiency. </p>  <p>The reason that most people have difficulty drawing realistically is not     because of any lack of physical skill or talent, but because they have not     been trained to really look at what they see. The rationale behind the method     we use in our drawing class is based on the one set forth by Betty Edwards     in her popular book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The theory behind     her work is that we develop and use drawn symbols as a kind of shorthand for     sorting visual information. This is because our culture and educational system     emphasize the processing of information in the verbal and analytical mode,     or what the author terms the L-mode (for left brain). This mode of thinking     is efficient because it condenses information into symbols but someone who     is over-dependent on it forfeits the capacity for careful observation. A person     using this mode will look at an object and quickly arrange it into a simplified     assortment of shapes. For instance, when looking at an eye, that person will     think to themselves "Oh that's a football shape with a circle inside that     has a black dot in the middle of it". Then the person looks at the paper and     draws a football shape with a circle and a black dot, never once looking back     at the eye to see if the image they created is accurate. A person who is trained     to observe, however, doesn't think about labeling the object but will easily     spend an hour or more drawing the shapes, the lines and their relationships     to each other. This person who, through the act of drawing, truly observes     an eye, understands how the lids fit over the eye, how the eyelid has a certain     thickness, how the eyelashes grow from the edge of the eyelid, how the pupil     is actually an opening into the eyeball, where the tears are formed and how     the eye fits into the skeletal and muscular structure of the head. By drawing     the eye, the person achieves a much better understanding of the organ than     they ever will by memorizing and labeling its parts, a phenomenon noted by     the neurologist Santiago Ramon y Cajal, when he stated that "…all great observers     are skillful in sketching." </p>  <p>Training a person to observe can be accomplished through a series of exercises     that require the student to complete tasks that are extremely difficult to     do analytically. For example, students are asked to draw the spaces around     objects they see or to copy drawings that are upside down. They have no labels     or shorthand symbols for these things and are forced to actually look at what     they are drawing in order to put anything down on paper at all. Although these     exercises can be quite difficult at first and even can cause headaches, with     perseverance they become less difficult as students practice the shift in     thinking from an analytical and labeling mode to one that is more intuitive     and holistic. This mental change in the method of processing information causes     a change of attitude as well. The student no longer experiences feelings of     impatience with detail and an anxiousness to "get on with it" but rather feels     a sense of curiosity and wonder and is often quite unaware of the passage     of time. Often, our students are amazed at the results and are soon quite     eager to continue their explorations of the world through the practice of     drawing. Many have stated that their experience of the world around them is     quite different after they have learned to draw. To be accurate, however,     it must be said that drawing a specimen does not replace what the student     learns during lectures, homework and readings but rather reinforces and internalizes     this information. The two modes of thinking work in conjunction to produce     a much deeper understanding than can be gained from either mode in isolation     from the other. </p>  <p>Although our drawing class is aimed specifically towards beginning biology     students, any discipline that requires the observation of an object or system     could take advantage of the benefits that training in drawing offers. The     procedures we use in the class can easily be adapted for students at any level     of biology, botany and anatomy. Using the same rational we have outlined in     this discussion, the University of California, Davis, includes drawing and     writing instruction in their fish taxonomy laboratory courses to increase     student interest and comprehension. (Description is published in the March/April     1999 issue of The Journal of College Science Teaching.) In addition, there     are many other areas that offer the potential to link the practice of the     arts to the study of science. The connections between math and music are well     documented (during Copernicus' time, the study of music was required for all     math students) but there are strong relationships between other areas of science     and art as well. The process of throwing a pot is a direct application of     physics principles as is using a hammer to shape a piece of metal. Glaze formulation     is pure chemistry and designing a comfortable, lightweight yet strong piece     of jewelry requires an understanding of both math and engineering. All art     students engage in self-examination and self-expression as well as develop     awareness of social and cultural issues when working on their individual projects.     Furthermore, students in art classes are self-motivated because they choose     to make and do things that are interesting to them. Through the making of     an object or the performance of music or a play, they practice problem solving     and creative thinking skills as well as the systematic application of the     concepts they are learning in their other classes. Re-establishing the lost     connections between the arts and sciences would benefit many students in many     areas of study. In the words of Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein: </p>      <p align="center">"Arts and sciences constantly interact in very fruitful ways         that are often overlooked…The arts are not merely for self-expression         or entertainment. They are…disciplines as rigorous as medicine or mathematics         with their own bodies of knowledge, tools, skills and philosophies. Moreover,         because the imaginative tools used in the arts are critical to the humanities         and the sciences, they deserve support not just for their own sake but         for the sake of education as a whole. Math, science and technology have         flourished in the past only when and where the arts have flourished. They         will flourish or fail together in the future." </p>      <p align="center"><a href="../hewlett.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image9','','images/arrows_02-over.gif',1)"><img name="Image9" border="0" src="images/arrows_02.gif" width="47" height="24"></a><a href="student.htm" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image10','','images/arrows_03-over.gif',1)"><img name="Image10" border="0" src="images/arrows_03.gif" width="63" height="24"></a></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><b>Bibliography</b>:<br>        <i>Climate for Creativity Report of the 7th National Research Conference         on Creativity</i> <br>        Editor, Calvin w.
