      <div class="paragraph">We investigated patterns of gene duplication and diversification within gene families presumed to be important to ecological and behavioral interactions. The mammalian genome contains hundreds of chemosensory receptors and taxa with larger repertoires are thought to have improved detection and discrimination among chemical cues. Pheromone receptors, in particular, are likely to be an important component of species recognition, mating behavior, and social behavior, and thus may play an important role in speciation. Strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises) are exceptionally diverse with respect to physiology, ecology, social and mating behavior, and patterns of species richness, thus providing an ideal context for testing the significance of chemosensory receptor evolution across multiple phylogenetic scales. </div></td>

      <div class="paragraph">My dissertation research quantified the loss of genetic diversity within breeding ponds of two species of desert anurans (<em>Bufo cognatus </em>and <em>Scaphiopus couchii</em>) due to 1) reproductive skew and 2) larval mortality, and examined the consequences of these local patterns for among group genetic structure. Comparing ecologically similar taxa across fine temporal scales and organizational units allowed me to link species traits, habitat characteristics, and within pond dynamics to population level patterns of genetic diversity.

The second project utilized material collected in field expeditions during the 1960's and 70's to characterize the reproductive cycle of male tropical salamanders that were previously thought to be acyclic (<a href="pdfs/Chan2003_BJLS.pdf" target="_blank">Chan 2003</a>).</div>

     <div class="paragraph">I also spent two summers working for Vance Vredenburg, now at San Francisco State University, on Mountain Yellow-Legged frog conservation. This was relatively early in the recognition of globally widespread amphibian declines and we were examining several potential causes of decline: introduced trout (already well-documented by Vance) and increased UV-B exposure decreasing hatching success and larval survivorship. We removed introduced trout from high elevation lakes to see native frogs return and breed. We also used experimental approaches to examine the effect of UV-B radiation on hatching success and larval behavior in three species of high elevation anurans (Vredenburg et al., in press; Romansic et al., in revision). </div>
