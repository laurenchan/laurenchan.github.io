<p>Select <a href="A02|A04|A05|A06|A07|A08|A09">all</a> remaining traces.  Click the <b>Predict Bins</b> button, choose each dye in turn, and just click <b>OK</b> in the dialogue that pops up.  Do the same for the other three dyes (not <font color="#FF9900"><b>LIZ</b></font>.)</p>
<p>This creates bins based on the observed peaks and their size using the current sizing algorithm.  Save now.</p>

<p>Go to the Alleles Table, turn on all the dyes and see if there are any unbinned peaks (displayed as red warning boxes with <b>Unbinned Peak</b>). If you have unbinned peaks, go to the affected trace document and turn on just the dye that has the unbinned peak.  Select the bin the peak should be in and choose <b>'Edit Bin'</b> and extend the range, or  just drag the bin to include the peak.</p>
<p>Go back to the Alleles table to see that the peaks are now binned.  Warnings about no peaks can be ignored in this case, as this means that no alleles were amplified in those samples.</p>

<p>Also, have a look at the <b>Allele Size Distribution</b> tab to see a graph showing the range of sizes.  Typically, you would only look at one microsatellite dye and see a range of steps indicating allele sizes.  Since this is such a small data set the steps aren't obvious, but if you look at the <font color="#FF9900"><b>LIZ</b></font> dye you can see what the steps would look like for a larger microsatellite data set:</p>

<p>The final step is to export the Alleles table to a <b>CSV</b> file which can be opened in a spreadsheet (such as Excel).  You can export with or without warnings.  If you export without warnings, it will leave those fields blank, otherwise they'll contain the text such as <i>No peaks</i>.</p>
<p>You're now done calling alleles and ready to move on to your next step of microsat analysis.</p>
