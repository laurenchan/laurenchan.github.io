I'm interested in the evolution and conservation of biological diversity. A lot of my research strives to understand the processes underlying patterns of diversity and differentiation in amphibians and reptiles. I'm collaborating with <a href="people.html">students</a>, government agencies, and colleagues at other universities and institutions on <a href="research.html">projects</a> throughout western North America. At Pacific, I <a href="teaching.html">teach</a> courses across the biology curriculum including introductory biology, vertebrate zoology, evolution, molecular ecology, and advanced research methods.

I typically combine field and genetic data to investigate both basic and applied questions in amphibians and reptiles, but research in my lab also involves using simulations, geospatial data, and computational approaches to address questions in a diversity of taxa. Here are summaries of some of my current research projects.
<h2>1) How does land use impact population connectivity?</h2>
The greater Portland metro area has remarkable natural areas of protected and restored wetlands and Pacific University is situated at the interface of suburbia, forest, and agriculture. We are interested in how this heterogeneous mix of land use practices impacts local amphibian populations.

<h4>Landscape genomics of the red-legged frog. </h4>In collaboration with Katy Weil at Metro, as well as Amy Truitt and others in Cat deRivera's lab at Portland State University, we are studying the effects of land use and habitat connectivity on population genetic diversity and connectivity of the red-legged frog, <em>Rana aurora</em>. We are interested in how particular landscape characteristics might impede or facilitate movement among breeding sites, and perhaps more importantly, identifying the site characteristics that support healthy breeding populations. Such information is important to land managers who are working hard to actively maintain habitat connecivity.

<h4>Land use and population connectivity of rough-skinned newts.</h4> In parallel to the work the red-legged frog, we are also investigating landscape connectivity of the rough-skinned newt, <em>Taricha granulosa. </em>This species is common in many wetlands, but absent from many urban areas. It is consider a highly mobile amphibian such that we expect high connectivity at large distances and among a diversity of land use types, but detailed study of their population genetics has not been done. Furthermore, rough-skinned newts, and other species in the same Family Salamandridae, are expected to be particularly vulnerable to a recently discovered fungal pathogen currently absent from North America. Understanding connectivity and spatial variation in skin microbial diversity in advance of possible introduction of this pathogen can contribute to future conservation efforts.
<h2>2) Conservation genetics of the Dunes Sagebrush Lizard</h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-310 alignleft" src="images/arenicolus1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="167" />The Dunes Sagebrush Lizard (left) is endemic to the Mescalero and Monahans Sand-Shinnery Oak ecosystems of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent Texas. With colleagues at Texas A&amp;M, I have been studying the effect that evolutionary and more recent anthropogenic factors have on population connectivity and persistence in this unique landscape. This includes range-wide phylogeographic data, fine-scale population genetic data, and the integration of these data with landscape and population ecology datasets. <a href="arenicolus.html">More here.</a>

<h2>3) Comparative phylogeography and population genetics</h2>
Understanding the role of organismal traits in patterns of evolutionary differentiation is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology with important implications for conservation. I am working with student and outside collaborators to tease apart the role of species traits and species histories in population genetic and phylogeographic structure. I have different projects in two distinct regions: the Mescalero-Monahans Shinnery Oak ecosystem and the Channel Islands of California.
