<h1>How to Cite Responsibly</h1>
<p>It is necessary, and important, to cite your references correctly and responsibly. Proper citations allow readers to follow your research, find relevant and related material, and verify your claims and findings. Clear, consistent, and correct formatting of citations is critical to readers being able to find references reliably. Sloppy and/or inconsistent citations only serve to aggravate the reader, undermine your credibility as a reputable scientist, and increase the probability of plagiarism.</p>

<p>Everything that you cite in the text should be listed in your references at the end of your paper. Everything listed in your references at the end needs to be cited at least once in the text. The exact formatting of citations within the text and in the References section at the end of the paper may vary across journals/courses/labs, but it is important that you use a consistent format within a document. A reader MUST be able to find all of the information you refer to in your paper so citing responsibly and carefully is critical. Â Sloppy citations/references are frustrating and can also constitute plagiarism.</p>

<p>Following is information on how to cite within text and at the end of a paper. As you look at formatting pay very careful attention to commas, quotes, capitalization, parentheses, italics, etc. Each of these are important details of formatting.</p>
